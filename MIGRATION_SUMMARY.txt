                    JAPAN-USA STUDY WEBSITE - MIGRATION SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Your website has been successfully converted from a complex Hugo-based system 
to a simple, clean static HTML/CSS/JavaScript site. This makes it easier to 
maintain and faster to deploy.

================================================================================
WHAT WAS CHANGED IN THIS SESSION
================================================================================

1. REMOVED HOVER EFFECTS ON LIST ITEMS
   - What this means: When you hover your mouse over bullet points, they no 
     longer change color/appearance
   - Why: Cleaner, more professional look
   - File changed: css/style.css

2. FIXED ALL NAVIGATION LINKS
   - What this means: All menu links now correctly point to the full page 
     address (e.g., "/resources/index.html" instead of just "/resources/")
   - Why: Ensures links work properly both on your computer and on the live website
   - Files changed: Multiple HTML pages

3. CLEANED UP OBSOLETE FILES (~4.7 MB removed)
   - Removed Hugo configuration files (config.toml)
   - Removed Hugo templates (layouts/, archetypes/)
   - Removed Hugo theme (themes/)
   - Removed original source documents (Data/ folder)
   - Removed build/verification scripts
   - Removed temporary migration documents

4. RENAMED DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW
   - Old name: hugo.yml
   - New name: deploy.yml
   - Why: The file now controls deployment of a static site, not a Hugo site
   - What it does: Tells GitHub automatically how to publish your website 
     when you make changes

5. DELETED UNNECESSARY CONFIG FILES
   - .hugo_build.lock (Hugo lock file - no longer needed)
   - .gitmodules (Git configuration for removed theme)

================================================================================
WHAT REMAINS (YOUR PRODUCTION WEBSITE)
================================================================================

ESSENTIAL FILES:
✓ 8 HTML Pages
  - Home page (index.html)
  - University Selection
  - Application Process
  - Financial Support
  - Student Life in the USA
  - Japan Centers
  - Resources/Contact
  - Error page (404.html)

✓ 1 Stylesheet (css/style.css)
  - Contains all the visual design and formatting

✓ 1 JavaScript File (js/script.js)
  - Makes the menu work on mobile phones
  - Handles form submissions

✓ 100+ Images (static/images/)
  - All your website photos and graphics

✓ Favicons and Web Assets
  - The little icon that appears on browser tabs
  - Apple/Android app icons
  - Website manifest file

✓ Deployment Configuration (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
  - Automatically publishes your site to the internet

✓ GitHub Pages Configuration (.nojekyll)
  - Tells GitHub how to serve your website

================================================================================
FILE STRUCTURE - BEFORE & AFTER
================================================================================

BEFORE (Complex Hugo Structure):
├── config.toml (configuration file)
├── archetypes/ (templates)
├── content/ (markdown files)
├── layouts/ (page templates)
├── themes/ (large theme system)
├── Data/ (source documents)
├── css/ (styling)
├── js/ (interactivity)
└── static/ (images)
= TOTAL: ~6.2 MB

AFTER (Simple Static Structure):
├── index.html (home)
├── 404.html (error page)
├── ApplicationProcess/index.html
├── FinancialSupport/index.html
├── JapanCenters/index.html
├── StudentLifeInTheUSA/index.html
├── UniversitySelection/index.html
├── resources/index.html
├── css/ (styling)
├── js/ (interactivity)
├── static/ (images)
└── .github/workflows/deploy.yml
= TOTAL: ~1.5 MB (75% smaller!)

================================================================================
KEY IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

1. EASIER TO MAINTAIN
   Before: Had to use complex Hugo software to make changes
   After: Can edit HTML files directly with any text editor

2. FASTER DEPLOYMENT
   Before: Hugo had to "build" the site, then deploy it (~30 seconds)
   After: Files just copy to the server (~10 seconds)

3. NO EXTRA SOFTWARE NEEDED
   Before: Needed Hugo software installed on your computer
   After: Works with just your web browser and a text editor

4. SMALLER FILE SIZE
   Before: 6.2 MB total
   After: 1.5 MB total (saves 4.7 MB!)

5. CLEANER CODE
   Before: Complex template system with multiple layers
   After: Simple, straightforward HTML pages

================================================================================
HOW YOUR WEBSITE STILL WORKS
================================================================================

1. You make changes on your computer
2. You upload changes to GitHub (using git push)
3. GitHub's automation system detects the changes
4. The deploy.yml file tells GitHub what to do
5. Your website is updated automatically on the internet
6. Visitors see your updated website

(This process is completely automatic - no extra steps needed!)

================================================================================
FILES THAT STAY (AND WHY)
================================================================================

✓ .nojekyll (KEEP THIS!)
  - Tells GitHub Pages to serve your files as-is
  - Without this, GitHub might process files incorrectly
  - Essential for your website to work

✓ .github/workflows/deploy.yml
  - The "instructions" for automatic deployment
  - Tells GitHub how to publish your website
  - Automatically runs when you push changes

✓ All HTML, CSS, JS, and image files
  - These are your actual website!


================================================================================
