### Our research

Irrigation is a critical component of land and water resource management. It facilitates nearly 40% of the world’s food supply and accounts for the lion’s share of global freshwater withdrawals: ~70% of total withdrawals and 84-90% of consumptive use. Furthermore, irrigation is also a complex driver of environmental change, including groundwater depletion, enhanced soil salinity, and nutrient leaching in agricultural systems. Copiously applied irrigation water also impacts regional hydroclimates as well as biogeochemical cycling. Demand for irrigation water, both in agriculture and other sectors will increase into the 21st century, which when coupled with climate change-induced water disruptions, may tax existing irrigation water supplies. It is therefore crucial to better understand irrigation impacts and interactions across natural and human systems to aid in improving projections of regional environmental/climate change and sustainable water resource management.

This website is host to the community of researchers studying the role of irrigation in the Earth system. The IES community is interdisciplinary - hailing from both the natural and social sciences - and comprises research spanning Earth observations, field and social data collection, and modeling efforts. The idea to create this community came from an [Aspen Global Change Institute](https://www.agci.org/workshops/7014x0000002IxWAAU/irrigation-in-the-earth-system-priorities-for-data-modeling-and-cross-disciplinary-research) workshop in June 2023 focused on irrigation. Our intent is to foster and enhance research collaborations, coordination, resource-sharing, and thinking on any and all facets of irrigation into the future. 

On these pages you can find and contribute the latest irrigation-related publications, opportunities, datasets, and other key resources. Please also sign up for our listserv for community sharing and periodic updates.

### How can I join the IES community listserv?
[Click here](https://groups.google.com/g/irrigation-earth-system) to sign up for our community listserv, on which you can post relevant announcements, papers, conferences, job opportunities, etc. We encourage you to use it. Subscribers can join in the discussion and reply to existing discussion threads, post new messages to share news or collaborate on projects, announce conferences, arrange meetings, advertise job opportunities and workshops or just to keep in touch with your colleagues specific to this group. 

We ask that you remain respectful and professional in all posts to this community, and to post on matters relevant to irrigation research. Inappropriate mailings and conduct will result in removal from the listserv.
