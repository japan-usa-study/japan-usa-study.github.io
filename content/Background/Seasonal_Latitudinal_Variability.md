## Abstract:
Superpressure balloon data of unprecedented coverage from Loon LLC is used to investigate the seasonal and latitudinal variability of lower stratospheric gravity waves over the entire intrinsic frequency spectrum. We show that seasonal variability in both gravity wave amplitudes and spectral slopes exist for a wide range of intrinsic frequencies and provide estimates of spectral slopes in five latitudinal regions for all four seasons, in five different frequency windows.

 The spectral slopes can be used to infer gravity wave amplitudes of intrinsic frequencies as high as 70 cycles/day from gravity waves resolved in model and reanalysis data. We also show that a robust relationship between the phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation and gravity wave amplitudes exists for intrinsic frequencies as high as the buoyancy frequency. These are the first estimates of seasonal and latitudinal variability of gravity wave spectral slopes and high-frequency amplitudes and constitute a significant step toward obtaining observationally constrained gravity wave parameterizations in climate models

## Key Points:
1. Loon LLC superpressure balloonscan be used to infer lowerstratospheric gravity wave (GW)motions over most latitudes and allseasons
2. Seasonal and latitudinal variabilityis found in GW spectral slopes andamplitudes over the full intrinsicfrequency spectrum
3. GW amplitudes are higher duringpositive QBO phases comparedto negative phases for intrinsicfrequencies up to the buoyancyfrequency
