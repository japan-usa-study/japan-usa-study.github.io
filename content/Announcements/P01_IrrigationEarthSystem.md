## Abstract:
Irrigation accounts for ~70% of global freshwater withdrawals and ~90% of consumptive water use, driving myriad Earth system impacts. In this Review, we summarize how irrigation currently impacts key components of the Earth system. Estimates suggest that more than 3.6 million km2 of currently irrigated land, with hot spots in the intensively cultivated US High Plains, California Central Valley, Indo-Gangetic Basin and northern China. Process-based models estimate that ~2,700 ± 540 km3 irrigation water is withdrawn globally each year, broadly consistent with country-reported values despite these estimates embedding substantial uncertainties. Expansive irrigation has modified surface energy balance and biogeochemical cycling.

Expansive irrigation has modified surface energy balance and biogeochemical cycling. A shift from sensible to latent heat fluxes, and resulting land–atmosphere feedbacks, generally reduce regional growing season surface temperatures by ~1–3 °C. Irrigation can ameliorate temperature extremes in some regions, but conversely exacerbates moist heat stress. Modelled precipitation responses are more varied, with some intensive cropping regions exhibiting suppressed local precipitation but enhanced precipitation downstream owing to atmospheric circulation interactions. Additionally, irrigation could enhance cropland carbon uptake; however, it can also contribute to elevated methane fluxes in rice systems and mobilize nitrogen loading to groundwater. Cross-disciplinary, integrative research efforts can help advance understanding of these irrigation–Earth system interactions, and identify and reduce uncertainties, biases and limitations.

## Significance Statement:
Irrigation research has expanded substantially since the early 2000s, resulting in increased amounts of regional data, updates to global irrigated area maps and the implementation of irrigation in process-based sectoral models (for example, models of agriculture and water) and coupled ESMs. Collectively, these data and model analyses reveal that irrigation has important interactions with Earth system components and processes, which must be further explored and bracketed in the context of model uncertainties. In particular, irrigation impacts climate processes by altering surface energy and moisture balances, exchanges with the atmosphere and biogeochemical cycling. These irrigation–Earth system interactions have implications for a range of ecosystem services, such as crop production, carbon sequestration on agricultural lands, water availability and even human health.
