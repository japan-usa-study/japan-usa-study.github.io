## Abstract:
The moderating influence of irrigation on dry heat extremes is well established, but the effect of irrigation on humid heat is more uncertain. Here, we study the impact of modern irrigation on both dry and humid heat-wave occurrences during the boreal summer using the NASA GISS Earth System Model (ModelE) with and without present-day irrigation. We show that the presence of modern irrigation reduces the total number of dry heat waves in most land areas, especially in arid and temperate regions.

In contrast, humid heat waves occur more frequently under modern irrigation, especially in the Mediterranean Sea region, northern Africa, southern Africa, and the Middle East. Present-day irrigation reduces dry heat extremes by favoring latent heating over sensible heating and lowering surface solar radiation by increasing total cloud cover. Meanwhile, modern irrigation drives increases in humid heat through increases in specific humidity and precipitation. Notably, the reduction in dry heat is mostly localized over irrigated grid cells while humid heat increases both in locally irrigated areas and remote (nonirrigated) regions because of widespread increases in humidity associated with irrigation. Our results suggest that irrigation may amplify humid heat, even in nonirrigated areas, highlighting the importance of improving our understanding of both local and remote effects of the irrigation forcing on climate hazards.

## Plain Language Summary:
Anthropogenic climate change is expected to increase the frequency of both dry and humid heat extremes over much of the world (IPCC 2021; Buzan and Huber 2020). How irrigation responses will change in a warming world, however, is a major unknown, with studies suggesting that the effects of irrigation could be amplified or diminished, depending on regional climate responses (Cook et al. 2011, 2020). Our study suggests irrigation may mitigate some of these increases in dry heat extremes but can further amplify moist heat occurrences. Furthermore, our results suggest that while irrigation is more impactful on dry heat at local scales, the same forcing can also drive large increases in humid heat events, even far afield from where the irrigation was applied. We therefore emphasize that considering the near and far-reaching impacts of irrigation, as well as other human-driven land surface changes, on both dry and humid heat extremes will be critical for understanding how heat extremes will change in the future.
