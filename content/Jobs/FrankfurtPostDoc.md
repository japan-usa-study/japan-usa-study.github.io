<p> The research group <a href="https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/45681958/Theory-of-Atmospheric-Dynamics-and-Climate">Theory of Atmospheric Dynamics and Climate</a> at the Institute of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences of the Goethe University in the city of Frankfurt invites applications for a Research Assistant / Postdoctoral Scientist for a three year position. The position includes a moderate participation in teaching. In case of successful performance an extension up to another three years is possible.

Within the project we aim to improve the understanding of relevant multiscale processes in the tropopause region and to specify their impact on composition, dynamics and ultimately on future climate and climate variability. The postdoctoral scientist will work on the unresolved-dynamics impact on transport and mixing in the tropopause region. The work will address the dynamics of gravity waves and their impact on tracers.

This shall be done within the weather and climate code ICON. For this purpose, the new multi-scale and Lagrangian gravity-wave model MS-GWaM, already implemented and running in ICON, shall be developed further, using theoretical considerations and numerical methods. Once adapted, ICON/MS-GWaM is to be used for studying the gravity-wave impact on residual circulation and mixing. Further inputs on the development of the theory and numerics of MS-GWaM would be most welcome, e.g. with regard to gravity-wave sources.

### Employment conditions:
The salary grade is based on the job characteristics of the collective agreement (TV-G-U) applicable to the Goethe University. This call stays opened after its initial deadline December 10, 2023.

### Qualifications:
PHD in in meteorology, physics, applied mathematics, fluid dynamics, or a related field.
Expected is a strong background in theory and/or modeling, a genuine interest in atmospheric dynamics as a field of research and the readiness to work (or learn working) with atmospheric weather and climate models.

### Document requested:
Applicants should send via e-mail to [Ulrich Achatz]({{< ref "/Team/" >}}):
1. a letter of motivation
2. a complete CV including a list of publications
3. copies of all relevant certificates
4. at least two contacts for reference letters
