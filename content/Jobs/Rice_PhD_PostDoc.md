<h2> Advisor: Pedram Hassanzadeh </h2>                                           

  <p> The <a href="http://pedram.rice.edu/">University of Chicago’s Climate Extremes Theory and Data Group</a> has multiple postdoc, research scientist, and PhD positions in the following three topics (and at their intersections):<p>  
    1) Extreme weather events and climate change (with a focus on dynamics and the extratropical atmospheric circulation)<br>  
    2) Scientific deep learning for multi-scale nonlinear dynamical systems (with a focus on developing general, rigorous frameworks for explainability and analysis) <br>
    3) Applications of deep learning to improve analysis, modeling, and prediction of climate variability, weather extremes, and geophysical turbulence (with a focus on subgrid-scale modeling and spatio-temporal forecast/emulation). In particular, there are a few openings in this area for the DataWave project. <!--This project is part of two multi-disciplinary collaborative initiatives involving several US and international teams: <a href="https://datawaveproject.github.io/">DataWave</a> and <a href="https://cssi-gws.github.io/">CSSI-GW</a>.--> </p>

We are looking for highly motivated applicants with strong backgrounds in one or more of these areas: climate dynamics, geophysical fluid dynamics, applied math, scientific deep learning, numerical analysis, and turbulence physics.
<p>
All Ph.D. students and researchers will benefit from our group’s involvement in multi-institutional, international collaborative projects such as the Schmidt Futures-supported <a href="https://datawaveproject.github.io/">DataWave</a> and NSF-supported <a href="https://cssi-gws.github.io/">GW-CSSI</a>. They will also benefit from UChicago’s thriving and expanding programs in Climate Science, AI+Science, Computational and Applied Math, Data Science, and Climate Systems Engineering.
